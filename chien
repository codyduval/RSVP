## What would you like to learn about ruby concurrency?
* I'd like to know how can we apply ruby concurrency to web development

## What do you wish ruby did better for concurrency?
* Concurrency in Ruby is not the focus of the community like other language. Although ruby 1.9 support fiber, it still doesn't take full advantage of the power of multi-core CPUs.
