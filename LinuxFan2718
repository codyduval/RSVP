What would you like to learn about ruby concurrency?

How to avoid the race condition where you create an object, and try to
grab the object from the database in an after_commit hook, and sometimes
Rails can't find it.

What do you wish ruby did better for concurrency?

I wish the problem described above didn't exist.'
