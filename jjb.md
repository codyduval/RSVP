## What would you like to learn about ruby concurrency?
  * even though i've ready a lot about different MRI thread behaviors and understand the difference between threads in 1.8 and 1.9, I still don't understand the benefot of OS threads in 1.9, if there is still a GIL.
  * how to do threadsafe rails
  * concurrency behavior differences between ruby implementations

## What do you wish ruby did better for concurrency?
  * no gil in MRI -- crossing fingers for 2.1
  * standard library threadsafe
