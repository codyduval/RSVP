What would you like to learn about ruby concurrency?
I haven't really looked into concurrency in Ruby, so I'm curious to see some examples.

What do you wish ruby did better for concurrency?
Again, not having looked into concurrency in Ruby I don't really know. It would be interesting to see if there's an actors model like Akka in Scala.
