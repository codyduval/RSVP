What would you like to learn about ruby concurrency?
  - What improvements to expect in 2.0
  - Any differences between the various implementations (jruby, ironruby, etc)
  - Comparisons with other languages that support concurrency (eg elixer).
  - Thoughts about how hardware changes in the future (more cores, etc) might make languages with concurrency more important.

What do you wish ruby did better for concurrency?
  - Maybe having native threads for better performance.
